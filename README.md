# Neos WebPush

This package provides a backend module to manage and send Web Push Notifications.

## Installation

1. Run the following command in your site package

    `composer require ewert/neos-webpush --no-update`

2. Then run `composer update` in your projects root folder.

3. Run the following command to migrate your database `./flow doctrine:migrate`

4. Finally you can add the `WebPushAdministrator` role to the users who need access to the new backend module.

## Configuration
Browsers need to verify your identity. A standard called VAPID can authenticate you for all browsers. <br />
You'll need to create and provide a public and private key for your server. <br />
These keys must be safely stored and should not change. <br />

When you open up the Backend Module for the first time, an example configuration like the following with autogenerated keys will be created for you. <br />

```yaml
Ewert:
  WebPush:
    vapid:
      publicKey: ''
      privateKey: ''
```

## Asking the users for Permission
To be able to send some messages to your users, you have to first ask them for permission. <br />
To do that, you just have to call the following JavaScript function: <br />

```javascript
window.EwertWebPush.requestPermission();
```
